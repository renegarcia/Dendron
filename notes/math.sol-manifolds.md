SOL is one of the eight Thurston's geometries of three dimensional manifolds. Topologically it is $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the metric
$$
ds^2 = e^{-2z}dx^2 + e^{2z}dy^2 + dz^2.
$$
It also is a solvable Lie group, such that the exponential map $\mathfrak{sol} \to \mathrm{SOL}$ is a diffeomorphism and the metric above described is left invariant with respect to the group operation
$$
(x,y,z) \cdot (x',y',z') = (x+ e^z x',y+ e^{-z} y', t + t').
$$
